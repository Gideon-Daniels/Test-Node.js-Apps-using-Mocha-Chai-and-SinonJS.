Mocha 
-is a test runner
-This just means that it is a tool that runs and executes our tests. 
Chai
- is an assertion library
Sinon
-provides stand-alone test spies, stubs, and mocks.
Spies :
- Creates fake functions which we can use to track executions
- We can determine whether the function has been executed and how many times it's been called.
-We can spy on existing function and get the same capability, to track those functions executions.
Stubs: 
-Has all the functionality of spies
-Enables us to replace functions
-We can return whatever we want or have our functions work in a way that suites us to be able to test multiple scenarios.
Mocks: They are fake methods, that have pre-programmed behavior and pre-programmed expectations.
